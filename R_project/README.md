Research has shown that asthma rates and hospitalizations are significantly higher in the South Bronx region. We investigate some of the factors which have been associated with this region's increased asthma rate, and see if these generalize over other areas of the city. We identify specific factors which deserve further research and attention from a public health outreach or research groups. 

EDA.Rmd contains main EDA. Draft of slides available at: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yxd6yet668xEpYzGnOrGlq_Xv-HOBPzZ6tTF-GXf06s/edit?usp=sharing. 

data_inspection.Rmd is just a notebook for exploring the datasets

.R files are import, cleaning, and conversion table scripts
